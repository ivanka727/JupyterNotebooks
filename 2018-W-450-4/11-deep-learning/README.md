# Deep Learning

---

This repository contains the first two lectures for the deep learning series, including:
* Deep Learning 1: Intro to Deep Learning, History and Biological Inspiration
* Deep Learning 2: Intro to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Image Classification with MNIST in Keras

There are no labs associated with these lectures.

Discussion topics:
* What advancements allowed for the growth of deep learning?
* What problem does the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) solve? Why is this important?
* What makes convolutions better at working with images than a fully-connected deep perceptron?
* What are some methods for reducing overfitting and regularizing your models?
* Is deep learning overkill for most of the applications you will encounter?
* What are some of the considerations when evaluating the need for deep learning vs. classical machine learning models?
* What is an optimizer? What other models we've learned have been optimized in a similar fashion?
* What tasks are CNNs particularly good at?
